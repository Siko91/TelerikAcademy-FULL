Class Command used to keep useless data in it. Such data was "EndIndexOfCommandName", and other variables like that.
They are not related to the command itself and should be forgotten right after being used.
I removed them... but I had to change the ICommand interface a bit.

Catalog.UpdateContent - It was waaay too slow! It removed, added and did other useless stuff. Fixed it to simple updating.
